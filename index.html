        <section class="main-section" id="Training_methods">
          <h2>Training methods</h2>
          <p>Below are some training methods suitable for different kinds of players. You should start off by doing the quest Cook's Assistant, as this will get you to level 4.</p>
          <section id="Training_alongside_fishing">
            <h3>Training alongside Fishing</h3>
            <p>This method is suitable for players wanting to train Cooking along with Fishing. If the player has at least 30 Cooking, 35 Fishing and has done Dragon Slayer I, they may want to choose the Corsair Cove Resource Area as a substitute place for training rather than at Karamja.</p>
            <section id="Level_1">
              <h4>Level 1</h4>
              <p>Shrimp can be caught without any requirements. They yield 30 experience per successful cooking. Cooked shrimps can be sold in the Grand Exchange for little profit however, they should only be used for food. The best place to net shrimps is Draynor.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Level_20">
              <h4>Level 20</h4>
              <p>Trout can be caught in Barbarian Village or in Lumbridge, provided you have level 20 Fishing. Trout are very handy and each of them give 70 experience. Power-cookers can even grab dropped raw trout from powerfishers and cook them. If you go to Barbarian Village on a populated world, there are usually people giving away free raw trout and salmon.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Level_30">
              <h4>Level 30</h4>
              <p>Tuna can be caught at Musa Point in Karamja by harpooning them at level 35 Fishing. Tuna yields 100 experience each successful cook, though the catching speed is slow. The dropped raw tunas from powerfishers can be taken to cook. If a player decides to use this method to train Cooking, a very busy world should be selected. There is no permanent cooking location so bring an axe and tinderbox to use on the trees by the dock.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Level_40">
              <h4>Level 40</h4>
              <p>Lobsters can be caught at Musa Point in Karamja at level 40 Fishing. Lobster yields 120 experience each cooking and catching speed is comparable to harpooning. There are rarely any lobster drops from powerfishers, thus fishing them yourself is better.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Level_45/50">
              <h4>Level 45/50</h4>
              <p>Swordfish can be caught in Musa Point in Karamja once level 50 Fishing is attained. Swordfish yields 140 experience each cooking. However, swordfish catching speed is the slowest among all free-to-play fish, because tuna are also caught while harpooning. While swordfish can be cooked starting at level 45, a higher Cooking level is recommended before starting to cook swordfish, as the chances of successfully cooking them are relatively low at lower Cooking levels.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="Alternate_method_to_level_without_burning_food">
              <h4>Alternate method to level without burning food</h4>
              <p>This is an alternate method to level Cooking without burning fish, using the highest-level food possible such that they cannot be burned; however, it will most likely be slower than the method suggested above. It is recommended to use the other methods to attain level 50 Cooking before beginning.</p>

              <p>Another method is to cook pizza from the level you're able to cook them all the way to 99. It is better experience than swordfish (143 vs 140), however, 3 steps are required to make them, making the hourly experience rate lower than swordfish. The prices change constantly, so check the prices before selling the pizzas.</p>

One jug, pot, pie dish and three cooking apple spawns are available in the guild. The process of making pies can be sped up if players bring their own jugs and pots prior. Wheat can be harvested in the field directly behind the guild, then made into flour using the mill. Collecting flour, water and mixing pastry dough can all be done on the 1st floor<sup>[<span class="floor" title="US convention; ground floor in the UK">US</span>]</sup>, then cooked using the ranges on the 2nd floor<sup>[<span class="floor" title="US convention; ground floor in the UK">US</span>]</sup>, while obtaining more equipment from the 3rd floor<sup>[<span class="floor" title="US convention; ground floor in the UK">US</span>]</sup>.</p>

              <p>Jugs and grapes can also be found inside the guild. Wine can be fermented within the guild by filling jugs with water from the sink on the ground floor, then using grapes on the jugs of water. Wine gives the highest Cooking experience per success, though grape spawning is slow. Nothing is needed to be brought prior. This method of training is somewhat expensive, but can give up to 2,800 experience per inventory (14 grapes/14 jugs of water).</p>

            <h3>Training with complex food</h3>
            <p>Complex food requires time to make and can initially be a bit costly, but can be very rewarding. Complex food basically has varied trips, ranging from Draynor to Wilderness. It is possible to power-level these kinds of food, simply by purchasing the final uncooked version of the food (an uncooked pie, for example) from the Grand Exchange, or trading with another player. This method is usually quite expensive, but in turn offers very fast experience.</p>

                <p>Redberry pies are the first complex food that can be made. As these pies serve no purpose at higher levels, a quick method shall be shown here. The supplies such as buckets or jugs can be bought from a general store, but it's best to obtain the berries from the bushes south-east of Varrock, straight north from the entrance to Al Kharid. After that, redberry pies can be made in bulk. This pie is one of the easiest to make due to the low level requirement, and often the most expensive one to sell in the Grand Exchange, possibly due to its quest use. Using the Cooks' Guild and bushes located on the outskirts of Varrock, a decent profit can be made, however the experience given is low compared to other cooking processes.</p>

                <p>Plain pizza can be made from one tomato, one cheese and one pizza base; the pizza base can be made by using a pot of flour with a jug of water or bought from Fat Tony in the Bandit Camp (Wilderness) for 4 coins each. To ensure quick buying of pizza bases, exactly 51 coins can be brought to buy exactly 10 pizza bases and 145 coins to buy 28 pizza bases, and immediately move to and from the bank. Due to the personal shop update, the respawn rate of shop supply is low and players might choose to make the pizza bases themselves or wait. Cheese and tomatoes can be taken from Aggie's house or Fat Tony's camp, but both of them have disadvantages. Draynor lacks a support of cooking ranges, and Fat Tony is in the Wilderness which means players are at risk of being attacked by other players. Bandits are also aggressive, meaning that lower-levelled players must take care if they choose to train with pizzas in the Wilderness. Cooking pizzas at the range in Al Kharid can earn up to 180,000 experience per hour.</p>

            <h3>Making jugs of wine</h3>
            <p>Jugs of wine can be made starting at 35 cooking, providing the fastest Cooking experience in the game for free-to-play, topping out at 470,000–490,000 experience per hour at level 68. Wine is not created at a range or fire; instead, players can combine a bundle of grapes with a jug of water in their inventory, creating an unfermented wine. After 12 seconds, the unfermented wine ferments into a jug of wine, granting 200 experience. If a new unfermented wine is made before the 12 seconds are up, the timer will reset back to 12 seconds, so experience for all the wine will be awarded at once 12 seconds after completely stopping the process of making wine. <span class="bold">Before level 68 Cooking</span>, there is also a chance to create a jug of bad wine instead depending on level, granting no experience.</p>
            <p>62,147 jugs of wine are required to go from 68 to 99 Cooking. Jugs of water and grapes can be bought en masse from the Grand Exchange and combined together at any bank.</p>

          <h2>Profitability</h2>
          <p>Players wishing to know the profits of cooking certain foods should consult the related calculators, such as Calculator:Cooking/Fish for profits from fish, and Cooking/Burn level to see what level different foods stop being burned.</p>
          <p>Fish, particularly the high level ones, play a big role in the cooking market. They make up the bulk of the food market, with high demands for both raw and cooked forms. Note that buying fish raw from the Grand Exchange and selling the cooked product in the Grand Exchange is not always profitable due to many players buying mass amounts of fish to get to 99 Cooking. For many fish there is often a price difference between cooked and raw fish.</p>
          <p>A way to train Cooking and gain a profit would be to make foods containing many steps. These foods give much more experience than fish when made from scratch, many cannot be burnt, and can be sold for modest profit in the Grand Exchange. The downside to this method is that it takes much longer to prepare the ingredients for combining.</p>

Grab 26 fish, a tinderbox, and a log you can burn, then step one tile away from the bank clerk and light a fire, then cook at it. This requires you to have one log to burn for every 26 fish you want to cook, but provides bonus Firemaking experience at no cost to your Cooking experience speed. Make sure to use the banks on the east side of the Grand Exchange, so that after lighting your fire you walk back directly in front of the bank clerk without any delay from walking. Alternatively, players often train Firemaking at the Grand Exchange, so you can use other player's fires instead, though they may go out in the middle of cooking or be further from the bank clerk. This is also the most convenient area to power level with jugs of wine, as they can be bought en masse from the clerk.</td>
